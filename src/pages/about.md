BadJS.org was created by me, <a href="https://jarrodoverson.com">Jarrod Overson</a>, because I noticed I had a bunch of malicious JavaScript lying around. If you like this sort of thing, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jsoverson">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/@jsoverson">Medium</a>.

If you have suggestions on how badjs.org can be improved, please send an <a href="mailto:badjs.org@gmail.com">email</a>.
